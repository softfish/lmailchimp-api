# lmailchimp-api

Simple package for MailChimp's List and member management.

## Package Functions Summary:

1. Create, update and remove a list
2. Add members to a list
3. Update members within a list
4. Remove member from a list

## Developer Note
I am going to fine tune this a bit more first before I upload it to packagist.org.

To use this package make sure you have obtained API key from your MailChimp account and set it into the .env file from laravel.

```
LMAILCHIMP_API_KEY=[your-api-key]
```
